In this repository, I am publishing small projects from my Java Web development training at SoftUni. 
Here, I acquired initial knowledge of Spring Boot and Rest API. In the various small applications, we explored different aspects of Spring Boot.
I created my first REST application with CRUD operations. I implemented basic Spring Security. We explored cookies, events, I learned how to throw custom exceptions, and many other things.
